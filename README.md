- This package allows the simulation of the scattering intensity and form factor of right prisms with a regular polygon as a cross section with any number n of sides. Both 1D intensity profile and 2D images can be simulated.
- It can also be used with the ipywidgets package to manually fit experimental data with the provided models.

### Installation
Package installation can be done from PyPI at https://pypi.org/project/prismformfactors.
